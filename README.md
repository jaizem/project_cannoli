# Project Cannoli
Experimental VR game where the player can throw various pastries around their environment. I will be updating my progress in this repository, hopefully providing a handy resource for others looking to explore indie VR game development. 

## Process
- create unreal engine account
- link to github
- download blender
- create project in github under GNU GPL 3.0 license
- begin rendering assets in Blender

I have found the following resources extremely helpful in this process:
- Blender Tutorials - http://www.blenderguru.com/
- Free Shaders - https://www.poliigon.com/search/free
- Manual - https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/index.html
